Gazette of the United-States, 4/15/1789
"The Gazette played a notable role in the development of political parties and early partisanship. It also played a leading role in inspiring the creation of its rival paper, the National Gazette, which was founded at the urging of anti-Federalist leaders Thomas Jefferson and James Madison as a vehicle for their party's own political self-promotion and polemics.
